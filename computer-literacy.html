                <p>
                    Computer literacy is basically the knowledge and ability to use a computer efficiently, and just how comfortable
                    one is with operating it. Computer literacy is not the same as computer programming, which focuses on the act of
                    designing and coding programs in computers. You can be very skilled in computer literacy without having to know
                    anything about programming!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Computer literacy can include a variety of technical skills such as understanding operating systems, 
                    applications, and basic computer hardware. It also involves the ability to navigate the internet, 
                    and other common functions of a computer.
