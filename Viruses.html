            When people think of dangers online they usually think of being hacked by some genius behind an
            anonymos persona writing hundreds of lines of code. The reality of it is much more mundane, as the main
            way you're in danger online is through malicious files or scams of some sort.

            The most common way of being hacked is by being tricked into downloading or running one of the previously mentioned
            malicious files.
            Malicious files are any files shared with the intent of harming your computer or extracting information from you.
            The most common way these are shared is through downloads online.

            Here is an example of a site where the main download the use is trying to get to is also surrounded by many fake download buttons.
            This is one of many strategies hackers might use to get you to download malicious files, so it's always good practice
            to not download anything suspicious like this.

        Another common strategy employed by bad actors is to send things known as phishing emails, in which they will try to get
        you to click on shady links by posing as some other entity.
