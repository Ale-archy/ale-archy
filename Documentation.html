            This is a website made for my computer science capstone project, where the goal was to
            come up with an application or program that will help others. I chose computer literacy
            because it's relevant to our class and because I've seen people struggle with concepts in
            IT before, so I thought a compilation of information about the topic would be helpful.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center">
            As to how I made this site, I used Microsoft's Visual Studio Code from my home desktop
            to write all the html and css code which is used on this site. When testing its functionality
            I ran the website directly from my computer's drive, but I had to be able to host it online to 
            make it accessible to any computer and to present it for class.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center">
            The website is currently being hosted on github, where I made a repository and uploaded all of the
            relevant files. There were a lot of things that needed tuning when convering it for github, but overall
            this is a free and relatively easy way to host a simple website.
        </p>

            Special thanks to my teacher Mrs. Duplessiss and to all my friends in class.
