            Computers come pre-built with a variety of programs that help you carry out basic functions,
            but sometimes there's better alternatives to these online or even programs that do things
            your computer can't by default.

            That's why I'll be dedicating this page to sharing some useful programs to download.

        <p class="text-center">
            7-zip is a free program which is used to "unzip" files on your computer. Usually, to be able to upload several files online
            they must be compressed into one singular file, a process called zipping. If you have a zipped file you must unzip it
            using Window's built-in "extract" feature. Alternatively, there exist programs like 7-zip which are much better at doing
            this since they provide you with a lot more options.

        <p>
            Historically, older versions of Windows and other operating
            systems did not come preinstalled with a file extractor, so programs like winRAR and 7-zip were the way to go.

        <p class="text-center">
            VLC is a program used to play different types of video and audio files on your computer. It supports many formats such as
            .mp4, .mov., and .mp3. It's a very popular and widely used program, and for good reason as it has many great features over
            other default media players which might be pre-installed with your operating system.
